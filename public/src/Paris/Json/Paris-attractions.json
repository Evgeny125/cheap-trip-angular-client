    "text": "The Panth\u00e9on in Paris is a must-visit attraction for budget travellers who want to experience the rich history and culture of the city. This iconic monument is a masterpiece of neoclassical architecture and a symbol of French national pride.

It was designed by the famous architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot and completed in 1790, after more than 30 years of construction.

The Panth\u00e9on also houses a museum, which showcases the history and significance of the monument, as well as temporary exhibitions.\nOne of the main highlights of visiting the Panth\u00e9on is the opportunity to climb to the top of the dome and enjoy panoramic views of Paris. The climb is not for the faint-hearted, as it involves climbing 206 steps, but the reward is well worth it. From the top, visitors can see the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral, and other famous landmarks of Paris.\nVisiting the Panth\u00e9on is not only a visual experience but also an emotional one.
