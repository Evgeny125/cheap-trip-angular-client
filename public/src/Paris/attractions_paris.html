                The Eiffel Tower: <br> to Experience Paris' Iconic Landmark on a Budget!
            </h5>

            <p>
                The Eiffel Tower in Paris is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world. It is a symbol of
                love, romance, and adventure, and it attracts millions of visitors every year. If you are a
                budget traveller, you might think that visiting the Eiffel Tower is out of your reach, but that
                is not true. In fact, there are many ways to experience the magic of the Eiffel Tower without
                breaking the bank. The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 for the World's Fair, and it was meant to
                be a temporary structure. However, it quickly became a beloved symbol of Paris and was allowed
                to remain standing. Today, it is one of the most visited attractions in the world, and it offers
                breathtaking views of the city. One of the main highlights of visiting the Eiffel Tower is the
                view. From the top of the tower, you can see the entire city of Paris, including famous
                landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The view is
                especially stunning at sunset, when the sky turns pink and orange and the lights of the city
                begin to twinkle. Another benefit of visiting the Eiffel Tower is the activities. You can take a
                guided tour of the tower, which will give you a deeper understanding of its history and
                significance. You can also climb the stairs to the second level, which is a great way to get
                some exercise and save money on the elevator ticket. And if you are feeling adventurous, you can
                even zip line from the second level of the tower! But perhaps the most important benefit of
                visiting the Eiffel Tower is the emotions it evokes. Standing at the foot of the tower, looking
                up at its towering height, you can't help but feel a sense of awe and wonder. And when you climb
                to the top and look out over the city, you feel a sense of freedom and possibility. The Eiffel
                Tower is a reminder that anything is possible, and that dreams can come true. In conclusion, the
                Eiffel Tower is a must-see attraction for budget travellers. It offers stunning views, exciting
                activities, and powerful emotions, all at an affordable price. So if you are planning a trip to
                Paris, be sure to add the Eiffel Tower to your itinerary. You won't regret it!
