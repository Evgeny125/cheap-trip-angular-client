      If you're a budget traveller looking for a destination 
      that offers a glimpse into India's rich history and culture, Agra Fort in Agra is a must-visit 
      attraction. This magnificent fort, also known as the Red Fort of Agra, is a UNESCO World Heritage 
      Site and one of the most iconic landmarks in India. Built in the 16th century by the Mughal emperor 
      Akbar, Agra Fort served as the main residence of the Mughal dynasty until the capital was shifted 
      to Delhi. The fort was later renovated and expanded by his grandson Shah Jahan, who also built the 
      Taj Mahal. The fort's red sandstone walls, intricate carvings, and impressive architecture are a 
      testament to the grandeur and opulence of the Mughal era. As you enter the fort, you'll be greeted 
      by the imposing gates and walls that surround the complex. The fort covers an area of 94 acres and 
      is divided into several sections, including the Jahangir Palace, Khas Mahal, Diwan-i-Khas, and 
      Diwan-i-Am. Each section has its own unique features and history, making it a fascinating place 
      to explore.\nOne of the main highlights of Agra Fort is the stunning views it offers of the Taj 
      Mahal. From the fort's walls, you can see the iconic white marble mausoleum in all its glory, 
      set against the backdrop of the Yamuna River. The fort also has several gardens and courtyards 
      where you can relax and soak in the beauty of the surroundings. Visiting Agra Fort is not just 
      about admiring the architecture and history, but also about experiencing the emotions and stories 
      that are embedded in its walls. As you walk through the fort's corridors and rooms, you can imagine 
      the grandeur and luxury of the Mughal court, the battles and conquests that took place, and the 
      love and tragedy that inspired the Taj Mahal.In conclusion, Agra Fort is a must-visit attraction 
      for budget travellers who want to experience the grandeur and history of India. With its stunning 
      architecture, breathtaking views, and rich cultural significance, it's a place that will leave you 
      in awe and wonder. So, pack your bags and head to Agra to witness this majestic marvel of Mughal 
      architecture
