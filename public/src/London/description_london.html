                London, the capital city of England, is a vibrant and bustling metropolis that offers a wealth of
                experiences for budget travellers. With its rich history, diverse culture, and stunning architecture,
                London is a city that never fails to impress. From the iconic Big Ben and the Tower Bridge to the modern
                Shard and the London Eye, the city's skyline is a sight to behold. London is a melting pot of cultures,
                with a vibrant arts scene, world-class museums, and a thriving music and theatre scene. The city is home
                to some of the world's most famous museums, including the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the
                Tate Modern. For those interested in history, the Tower of London is a must-visit, while the Houses of
                Parliament and Buckingham Palace are also popular attractions. London is also known for its festivals
                and events, with something happening almost every week. From the Notting Hill Carnival to the Christmas

I'm CheapTrip.Guru, and I'm here to share with you my latest discovery in London - the British Museum. Now, I know what you're thinking - museums are boring and expensive. But trust me, this one is different. First of all, let's talk about the price. The best part? It's completely free! That's right, you can explore the wonders of the British Museum without spending a single penny. And let me tell you, there are plenty of wonders to explore. From the Rosetta Stone to the Egyptian mummies, the British Museum is home to some of the most fascinating artefacts in the world. And the best part? You don't have to be a history buff to appreciate them. Even if you're not particularly interested in ancient civilisations, you'll still find yourself in awe of the sheer scale and beauty of these artefacts. But the British Museum isn't just about the past. It's also a hub of contemporary art and culture. There are always new exhibitions and events taking place, so be sure to check out their website before you go. And let's not forget about the building itself. The British Museum is housed in a stunning neoclassical building that is a work of art in itself. You could spend hours just admiring the architecture and the beautiful courtyard. So, if you're looking for a budget-friendly activity in London that is both educational and entertaining, look no further than the British Museum. And if you see me there, be sure to say hi - I'll be the one geeking out over the Rosetta Stone. Until next time, happy travels!",
