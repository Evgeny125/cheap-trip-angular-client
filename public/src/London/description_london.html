                London, the capital city of England, is a vibrant and bustling metropolis that offers a wealth of
                experiences for budget travellers. With its rich history, diverse culture, and stunning architecture,
                London is a city that never fails to impress. From the iconic Big Ben and the Tower Bridge to the modern
                Shard and the London Eye, the city's skyline is a sight to behold. London is a melting pot of cultures,
                with a vibrant arts scene, world-class museums, and a thriving music and theatre scene. The city is home
                to some of the world's most famous museums, including the British Museum, the National Gallery, and the
                Tate Modern. For those interested in history, the Tower of London is a must-visit, while the Houses of
                Parliament and Buckingham Palace are also popular attractions. London is also known for its festivals
                and events, with something happening almost every week. From the Notting Hill Carnival to the Christmas
                markets, there is always something to see and do. The city is also famous for its food, with a wide
                range of international cuisines on offer. From traditional fish and chips to Indian curries and Chinese
                dim sum, there is something for everyone. One of the most surprising facts about London is that it is
                home to over 8 million people, making it one of the largest cities in the world. Despite its size,
                however, the city is easy to navigate, with an extensive public transport system that includes buses,
                trains, and the famous London Underground. For budget travellers, there are plenty of free or low-cost
                attractions to enjoy. The city's parks, including Hyde Park and Regent's Park, are perfect for a picnic
                or a leisurely stroll. The South bank Centre and the National Theatre offer free performances and events
                throughout the year, while the street art in Shored itch and Camden is a must-see.
