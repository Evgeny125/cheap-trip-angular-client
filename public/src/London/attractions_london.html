                them. The museum offers free guided tours, talks, and workshops that allow visitors to learn
                more about the objects and their cultural significance. The Great Court, a stunning glass-roofed
                courtyard, is a perfect spot to relax and admire the beauty of the museum's architecture. The
                British Museum is a sensory feast that appeals to all the senses. The smell of ancient
                artefacts, the sound of footsteps echoing in the galleries, the touch of the smooth marble
                sculptures, and the taste of a cup of tea in the museum's cafe all contribute to the immersive
                experience. In conclusion, the British Museum is a must-visit attraction for budget travellers
                who want to explore the rich history and culture of London. With its vast collection of
