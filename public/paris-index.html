            </span>
            <p class="city-details__li-text">
              Hey there, fellow budget travellers! I'm CheapTrip.Guru, your go-to guide for affordable adventures around
              the world. Today, I'm here to talk about one of the most iconic landmarks in the world - the Eiffel Tower
              in Paris.
              Now, I know what you're thinking - "Isn't the Eiffel Tower super expensive?". Well, my friend, it doesn't
              have to be. Here are some tips on how to experience the Eiffel Tower without breaking the bank.
              First things first, skip the elevator and take the stairs. Yes, it may sound daunting, but trust me, it's
              worth it. Not only will you save money, but you'll also get a great workout and some stunning views along
              the way.
              If you do decide to take the elevator, opt for the stairs to the second floor and then take the elevator
              to the top. This will save you some cash and still give you a great view of the city.
              Another tip is to visit the Eiffel Tower at night. The tower is beautifully lit up and you can see the
              city lights twinkling below. Plus, it's usually less crowded at night, so you can avoid the long lines and
              enjoy a more peaceful experience.
              If you're really on a tight budget, you can even enjoy the Eiffel Tower from afar. There are plenty of
              parks and viewpoints around the city where you can get a great view of the tower without paying a cent.
              So, there you have it - some tips on how to experience the Eiffel Tower without breaking the bank. As for
              me, I'll be enjoying a croissant and some coffee while admiring the view. Bon voyage, my fellow budget
              travellers!"

                Budget!</span>
              <p class="city-details__li-text">
                Hey there, fellow budget travellers! It's your favourite penny-pinching adventurer, CheapTrip.Guru, here
                to share some tips on how to experience one of Paris' most iconic landmarks without breaking the bank.
                That's right, I'm talking about the one and only Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now, I know what you're thinking.
                But CheapTrip.Guru, isn't Notre-Dame one of the most expensive tourist attractions in Paris?
                Well, my friends, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't have to be. With a little bit of planning and
                some insider knowledge, you can see this stunning cathedral without spending a fortune.
                First things first, let's talk about getting there. The easiest and cheapest way to reach Notre-Dame is
                by taking the metro. Taking the metro is a great way to experience Paris like a local.
                Now, onto the main event: visiting Notre-Dame itself. The good news is that admission to the cathedral
                is completely free! That's right, you can see the stunning stained glass windows,
                intricate carvings, and soaring ceilings without spending a single euro. Just be prepared to wait in
                line, as it can get quite crowded during peak tourist season.
                If you want to take your Notre-Dame experience to the next level, consider climbing the towers. This
                will give you a breathtaking view of Paris and the chance to get up close and personal with the famous
                gargoyles.
                However, there is a fee for this (around 10 euros), so it's up to you to decide if it's worth
                it.Finally, if you're looking for a souvenir to remember your Notre-Dame visit, skip the overpriced gift
                shops and head to the nearby Shakespeare and Company bookstore.
                This iconic shop has been a Parisian institution for over 60 years and is the perfect place to pick up a
                book or literary-themed gift.
                So there you have it, folks. CheapTrip.Guru's guide to seeing Notre-Dame Cathedral on a budget.
                Remember, just because you're travelling on a shoestring doesn't mean you have to miss out on Paris'
                most famous landmarks. Happy travels!

                  The Louvre Museum: How to See the Mona Lisa Without Breaking the Bank!</span>
                <p class="city-details__li-text">

                  Hey there, fellow budget travellers! It's your favourite CheapTrip.Guru here, ready to spill the tea
                  on how to experience the Louvre Museum in Paris without spending a fortune.
                  And let's be real, who doesn't want to see the Mona Lisa in person? First things first, let's talk
                  about tickets. The Louvre offers free admission on the first Saturday of every month from October to
                  March,
                  and on Bastille Day (July 14th). If you're not able to make it on those days, fear not! The museum
                  also offers free admission to visitors under the age of 18, as well as EU residents under the age of
                  26.
                  So, if you fit into any of those categories, you're in luck! Now, let's talk about timing. The Louvre
                  is open late on Wednesdays and Fridays, so take advantage of those extended hours to avoid the crowds.
                  Trust me, you don't want to be stuck in a sea of tourists while trying to admire the art. Speaking of
                  art, the Louvre is home to over 35,000 works of art, so it's easy to get overwhelmed. My advice? Focus
                  on the highlights. Obviously, the Mona Lisa is a must-see, but don't forget about other iconic pieces
                  like the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo. And finally, let's talk about food.
                  The Louvre has several restaurants and cafes, but they can be quite pricey. Instead, pack a picnic and
                  enjoy it in the Jardin des Tuileries, which is located right outside the museum.
                  Not only will you save money, but you'll also get to enjoy a beautiful view of the Louvre's iconic
                  pyramid. So there you have it, folks. With a little bit of planning and some insider tips from yours
                  truly,
                  you can experience the Louvre Museum without breaking the bank. Happy travels!

It's your favourite CheapTrip.Guru here, ready to spill the tea on how to experience the Louvre Museum in Paris without spending a fortune. And let's be real, who doesn't want to see the Mona Lisa in person? First things first, let's talk about tickets. The Louvre offers free admission on the first Saturday of every month from October to March, and on Bastille Day (July 14th). If you're not able to make it on those days, fear not! The museum also offers free admission to visitors under the age of 18, as well as EU residents under the age of 26. So, if you fit into any of those categories, you're in luck! Now, let's talk about timing. The Louvre is open late on Wednesdays and Fridays, so take advantage of those extended hours to avoid the crowds. Trust me, you don't want to be stuck in a sea of tourists while trying to admire the art. Speaking of art, the Louvre is home to over 35,000 works of art, so it's easy to get overwhelmed. My advice? Focus on the highlights. Obviously, the Mona Lisa is a must-see, but don't forget about other iconic pieces like the Winged Victory of Samothrace and the Venus de Milo. And finally, let's talk about food. The Louvre has several restaurants and cafes, but they can be quite pricey. Instead, pack a picnic and enjoy it in the Jardin des Tuileries, which is located right outside the museum. Not only will you save money, but you'll also get to enjoy a beautiful view of the Louvre's iconic pyramid. So there you have it, folks. With a little bit of planning and some insider tips from yours truly, you can experience the Louvre Museum without breaking the bank. Happy travels!",

          "description": "Hey there, fellow budget travellers! It's your favourite penny-pinching adventurer, CheapTrip.Guru, here to share some tips on how to experience one of Paris' most iconic landmarks without breaking the bank. That's right, I'm talking about the one and only Notre-Dame Cathedral. Now, I know what you're thinking. But CheapTrip.Guru, isn't Notre-Dame one of the most expensive tourist attractions in Paris? Well, my friends, I'm here to tell you that it doesn't have to be. With a little bit of planning and some insider knowledge, you can see this stunning cathedral without spending a fortune. First things first, let's talk about getting there. The easiest and cheapest way to reach Notre-Dame is by taking the metro. Taking the metro is a great way to experience Paris like a local. Now, onto the main event: visiting Notre-Dame itself. The good news is that admission to the cathedral is completely free! That's right, you can see the stunning stained glass windows, intricate carvings, and soaring ceilings without spending a single euro. Just be prepared to wait in line, as it can get quite crowded during peak tourist season. If you want to take your Notre-Dame experience to the next level, consider climbing the towers. This will give you a breathtaking view of Paris and the chance to get up close and personal with the famous gargoyles. However, there is a fee for this (around 10 euros), so it's up to you to decide if it's worth it. Finally, if you're looking for a souvenir to remember your Notre-Dame visit, skip the overpriced gift shops and head to the nearby Shakespeare and Company bookstore. This iconic shop has been a Parisian institution for over 60 years and is the perfect place to pick up a book or literary-themed gift. So there you have it, folks. CheapTrip.Guru's guide to seeing Notre-Dame Cathedral on a budget. Remember, just because you're travelling on a shoestring doesn't mean you have to miss out on Paris' most famous landmarks.
